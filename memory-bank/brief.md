# Sports Performance Monitoring System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive full-stack web application designed for monitoring and analyzing athlete performance data. The system provides tools for tracking biometric metrics, genetic profiles, body composition, and training load trends to optimize athletic performance and prevent injuries.

## Core Features
- **Athlete Management**: Complete athlete profiles with personal information, sports classification, and team assignments
- **Biometric Data Tracking**: Heart rate variability, resting heart rate, SpO2 levels, sleep metrics, and body temperature
- **Genetic Profiling**: DNA analysis integration for personalized training and recovery recommendations
- **Body Composition Analysis**: Detailed measurements including weight, fat mass, muscle mass, and BMI tracking
- **Training Load Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of training intensity and recovery needs
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive administrative interface for data management and user administration

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive data models
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication with role-based access control
