# Project Context: Sports Performance Monitoring System

## Project Genesis
This application was developed to address the growing need for comprehensive athlete performance monitoring in professional and amateur sports organizations. The system provides coaches, sports scientists, and medical staff with detailed insights into athlete health, performance metrics, and recovery needs.

## Current State
The application is in active development with a fully functional prototype that includes:

### ✅ Completed Core Features
1. **Authentication System**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Coach, Medical Staff)
   - Secure password management
   - Session handling

2. **Athlete Management**
   - Complete athlete profiles with personal information
   - Sports classification and team assignments
   - Athlete code generation for easy identification
   - Active/inactive status management

3. **Biometric Data Collection**
   - Heart rate variability (HRV) tracking
   - Resting heart rate monitoring
   - Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels
   - Sleep quality metrics (deep, REM, light sleep)
   - Body temperature tracking
   - Respiratory rate monitoring

4. **Genetic Profiling Integration**
   - DNA test result management
   - Gene variant analysis
   - Personalized recommendations based on genetic markers
   - Test status tracking (pending, completed, failed)

5. **Body Composition Analysis**
   - Weight and BMI tracking
   - Body fat percentage calculations
   - Muscle mass measurements
   - Skeletal muscle index (SMI)
   - Visceral fat assessment
   - Body symmetry analysis

6. **Training Load Management**
   - Training intensity tracking
   - Recovery time recommendations
   - Load distribution analysis
   - Performance trend monitoring

7. **Administrative Dashboard**
   - Complete CRUD operations for all entities
   - User management system
   - Role and permission management
   - Data import/export capabilities
   - System configuration options

## Technical Architecture
The application follows modern web development best practices:

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable UI components
- **Custom hooks** for data fetching and state management
- **Context API** for global state management

### Backend Architecture
- **Node.js/Express.js** server with RESTful API design
- **PostgreSQL** database with comprehensive schema
- **JWT authentication** with secure token management
- **Environment-based configuration** for different deployment stages
- **Error handling and logging** for production reliability

### Database Design
The database schema includes 15+ interconnected tables:
- Users and authentication
- Athletes with personal and sports data
- Biometric measurements with time-series data
- Genetic test results and profiles
- Body composition tracking
- Training load and performance metrics
- Organizations and sports classifications
- User roles and permissions

## Recent Developments
### Environment Configuration Fix
- **Problem**: Hardcoded localhost URLs preventing production deployment
- **Solution**: Implemented environment variable configuration
- **Impact**: Application now deployable to any environment (development, staging, production)

### Code Quality Improvements
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
